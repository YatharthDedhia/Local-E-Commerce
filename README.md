# Local-E-Commerce
## REVIVAL OF LOCAL STORES:
1. Due to increasing competition from online shopping during the Covid-19 outbreak which has been the case since, local shops, have seen a downfall in their sales and profit. This is mainly due to the fact that online shopping allows ppl to select and buy products from the comfort of one's home.
2. Since our application also ensures user comfort to an end and there are shops who provide delivery, local businesses will boost.
3. It is important to note that we are not limiting products from the customers as they can also compare products available on shopping websites.

## FUNCTIONS (For users) :
1.  *To filter out shops which contain xyz item and sort the shops/items based on brand reviews/shop reviews/product reviews/price/size/region/material ,etc.* Lets say I want a pressure cooker but Iâ€™m not aware of the prices of various companies and various sizes in my locality. So I, as a user of the app, can easily select an appropriate pressure cooker in approx 10-15 min. I can check the available colors and also the amount of stock left.
2.  *Comparison of various products  and their specs can also be performed.*
Furthermore, if the shop has ample staff, I can choose a delivery option, although the same cannot be said for all shops. *Delivery from local shops will also take considerably less time.*
3.*Booking of products:* Customers can also book products on the application.
4.  As one important goal is to help the customer with buying the product for the cheapest price possible, *the app can also compare products on various online websites such as amazon, flipkart, etc.*
