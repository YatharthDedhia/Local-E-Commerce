# Local-E-Commerce
## REVIVAL OF LOCAL STORES:
1. Due to increasing competition from online shopping during the Covid-19 outbreak which has been the case since, local shops, have seen a downfall in their sales and profit. This is mainly due to the fact that online shopping allows ppl to select and buy products from the comfort of one's home.
2. Since our application also ensures user comfort to an end and there are shops who provide delivery, local businesses will boost.
3. It is important to note that we are not limiting products from the customers as they can also compare products available on shopping websites.
